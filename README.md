# Machine-Learning Automatidata
We are creating a machine learning model for a fictional Taxi company 'Automatida' to ancipate cost of traveling for passengers in respect to multiple features. We will implement feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. 
## Background on the Automatidata scenario
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior.

## Your assignment
You will create a machine learning model for the TLC data. You will be responsible for leading these tasks, which include feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. 

###Specific project deliverables
In this end-of-course project, you will gain valuable practice of your new skills as you complete the following deliverables:

Complete a PACE planner mapping questions, details, and action items for each stage of the project scenario

Design and implement a machine learning model

Draft an executive summary of your results
